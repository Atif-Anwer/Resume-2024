We discuss several applications of topic modelling in the safety and security domain and list several topic model variations that are of special interest to the IW domain.},

	abstract     = {Social engineering is deeply entrenched in both computer science and social psychology. Knowledge on both of these disciplines is required to perform social engineering based research. There are several ethical concerns and requirements that need to be taken into account whilst performing social engineering research on participants to ensure that harm does not come to the participants. These requirements are not yet formalised and most researchers are unaware of the ethical concerns whilst performing social engineering research. This paper identifies several ethical concerns regarding social engineering in public communication, penetration testing and social engineering research. This paper discusses the identified ethical concerns with regards to two different normative ethics approaches namely utilitarianism and deontology. All of the identified ethical concerns and their corresponding ethical perspectives are provided as well as practical examples of where these formalised ethical concerns for social engineering research can be utilised.},

	abstract     = {The field of wireless sensor networking is still a new and upcoming one and, unfortunately, still lacking in terms of digital forensics. All communications between different nodes (also known as motes) are sent out in a broadcast fashion. These broadcasts make it quite difficult to capture data packets forensically whilst retaining integrity and authenticity of the data packets. This paper examines whether and how one can add a digital forensic readiness layer to an existing IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor network without any modification to the existing wireless sensor network. This paper also provides demonstrations of a working prototype to show that a digital forensic readiness layer can be added to an existing wireless sensor network, if the prototype adheres to a list of requirements in order to achieve digital forensic readiness in a wireless sensor network environment. This is done by performing several demonstrations which resemble real world wireless sensor network scenarios in order to show that the prototype does indeed add a layer of digital forensic readiness to the existing wireless sensor network.},

The difficulty with social engineering attacks is mostly the ability to identify them. Social engineers target call centre employees, as they are normally underpaid, under skilled workers whom have limited knowledge about the information technology infrastructure. These workers are thus easy targets for the social engineer. This paper proposes a model which can be used by these workers to detect social engineering attacks in a call centre environment. The model is a quick and effective way to determine if the requester is trying to manipulate an individual into disclosing information to which the requester does not have authorization for.},
